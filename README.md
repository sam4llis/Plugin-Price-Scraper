# Plugin-Price-Scraper

A web-scraper designed to extract pricing information from audio plug-in companies. At this moment, a database of prices from [Universal Audio](https://www.uaudio.com) plug-ins are being collected. In the future, a website will be created with real-time graphs which will utilise this data.

# UPDATE: 21/01/2022

I have now gathered approximately three months of data (November 2021 - January 2022) and the data shows some promising results as to how Universal Audio plug-ins fluctuate in price. At the moment, I am learning the [Angular](https://angular.io) framework in the hopes of building a website displaying this information for the audio community. This will be a work-in-progress throughout 2022.
